# open weather API

View [live](https://open-weather-api-five.vercel.app)

Weather app that uses the openWeatherAPI to get data and displays weather information based on the country searched on the input.

I created this project using HTML, SCSS and JavaScript, this was my first project built using scss and it was really easy to learn thanks to my previous css knowledge.

I also got the openWeather condition api which displays weather icons based on the location's id, so when the user searches a location, it displays the weather info + an icon showing the weather's conditon right next to the location's name.
